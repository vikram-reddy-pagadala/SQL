    "- For user_id 1, their third transaction occurred on 2023-11-18 at 13:49:42 with an amount of $65.56, surpassing the expenditures of the previous two transactions which were $7.44 on 2023-11-02 at 12:15:23 and $49.78 on 2023-11-12 at 00:13:46. Thus, this third transaction will be included in the output table.\n",
    "- user_id 2 only has a total of 2 transactions, so there isn't a third transaction to consider.\n",
    "- For user_id 3, the amount of $7.0 for their third transaction is less than that of the preceding two transactions, so it won't be included.\n",
