    "User 5: Like Users 1 and 2, User 5 made only 1 post throughout February, leading to the same average and max 7-day posting metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "User 3: Although User 3 made more posts than the others (3 posts), they did not reach twice the average weekly posts in their consecutive 7-day window, so they are not listed in the output.\n",
