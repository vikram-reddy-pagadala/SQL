    "- 2 cities (Newark, New York City) start with 'N' (same as state)\n",
    "- matching_letter_count = 2\n",

    "**California** is not included in the output because:\n",
    "- Although it has 4 cities (meets minimum requirement)\n",
    "- No cities start with 'C' (doesn't meet the matching letter requirement)\n",
