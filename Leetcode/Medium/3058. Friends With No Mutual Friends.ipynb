    "- Users 1 and 5 are friends with each other, but they share a mutual friend with user ID 2, so this pair is not included.\n",
    "- Users 6 and 7, as well as users 8 and 9, are friends with each other, and they don't have any mutual friends, hence included.\n",
    "- Users 3 and 4 are friends with each other, but their mutual connection with user ID 2 means they are not included, similarly for users 2 and 5 are friends but are excluded due to their mutual connection with user ID 1.\n",
