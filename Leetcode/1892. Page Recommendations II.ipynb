    "Explanation: \n",
    "Take user 1 as an example:\n",
    "  - User 1 is friends with users 2, 3, 4, and 6.\n",
    "  - Recommended pages are 23 (user 2 liked it), 24 (user 3 liked it), 56 (user 3 liked it), 33 (user 6 liked it), and 77 (user 2 and user 3 liked it).\n",
    "  - Note that page 88 is not recommended because user 1 already liked it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example is user 6:\n",
    "  - User 6 is friends with user 1.\n",
    "  - User 1 only liked page 88, but user 6 already liked it. Hence, user 6 has no recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can recommend pages for users 2, 3, 4, and 5 using a similar process.\n",
