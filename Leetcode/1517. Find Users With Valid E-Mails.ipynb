    "In SQL, regular expressions (regex) allow you to search for patterns within strings. MySQL supports regular expressions through the REGEXP or RLIKE operators.\n",

    "Common Regex Patterns:\n",
    "^: Matches the start of a string.\n",
    "$: Matches the end of a string.\n",
    ".: Matches any single character.\n",
    "[abc]: Matches any character inside the brackets.\n",
    "[a-z]: Matches any character in the range from a to z.\n",
    "|: Acts as OR (alternation).\n",
    "*: Matches 0 or more occurrences of the preceding element.\n",
    "+: Matches 1 or more occurrences of the preceding element.\n",
    "{n,m}: Matches between n and m occurrences of the preceding element.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Queries:\n",
    "Match rows where name starts with 'A':\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name REGEXP '^A';\n",
    "Match rows where email ends with '.com':\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT * FROM users WHERE email REGEXP '.com$';\n",
    "Match rows where phone_number contains exactly 3 digits followed by a hyphen and 4 digits:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT * FROM contacts WHERE phone_number REGEXP '^[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4}$';\n",
    "Match rows where address contains the word \"Street\" or \"Avenue\":\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT * FROM addresses WHERE address REGEXP 'Street|Avenue';\n",
    "Match rows where username contains only letters and numbers (no special characters):\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username REGEXP '^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$';\n",
    "Case-Sensitivity:\n",
    "By default, REGEXP is case-insensitive. To make it case-sensitive, use the BINARY keyword:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE BINARY column_name REGEXP 'pattern';\n",
    "Negation (NOT REGEXP):\n",
    "You can negate a regex match using NOT REGEXP:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username NOT REGEXP '^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$';\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Regex in Other Databases:\n",
    "PostgreSQL: Use ~ or ~* (case-insensitive).\n",
    "SQL Server: Use PATINDEX or LIKE (regex is not natively supported, but similar functionality exists).\n",
    "Oracle: Use REGEXP_LIKE().\n",
